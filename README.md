# Share My Ride

## Description

The Airbnb of the automotive world.  Users can list their vehicles and towed trailers for rent, set availability, and rates.  Users can also choose to rent vehicles listed by other uses by browsing the vehicles available for rent for a given location and time frame.  Renters can review the vehicles and people they have rentded from, while those who rent their vehicles can review the people who rented from them.  Renters will also be able to filter available vehicles by date, location, price, type of vehicle, and from their favourites.  Payments will be made through Carbnb and the appropriate amount paid to vehicle owners.

There will be an administrative interface for Carbnb employees to perform administrative tasks such as featured vehicles and promotions, or to resolve technical issues with users.

Business consideration and legal issues will not be resolved (such as insurance, and financial capaility).

## Target Audience

The target audience will be travellers of all types as well as those looking to spend some time in a car they do not own.
